## Requirements

To run the program the following are needed:
* npm
* Node.Js 

## How to Run

`cd` into the application folder and run:
- `npm install` to install necessary dependencies
- `npm run start` in one terminal to start the Express server.
- `npm run build` in a different terminal to start the Webpack Dev server.

The app runs on http://localhost:8081/ (the default port) while the server runs on port 8080.
The server port can be changed in the server.js file.
